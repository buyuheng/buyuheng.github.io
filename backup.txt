== To Prospective Students

PhD candidates: *Self-motivated* students with strong backgrounds in *probability*, *statistics*, *machine learning*, and *information theory* are welcome to reach out.  You should be comfortable with writing and reading proofs and learning challenging new mathematical concepts; in other words, a decent [https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/theres-more-to-mathematics-than-rigour-and-proofs/ mathematical maturity] is required. 

Please send me an email with the subject "Prospective Ph.D. Student" attached with your academic CV and undergraduate/graduate transcripts.
