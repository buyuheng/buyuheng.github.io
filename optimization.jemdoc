== Course Description
This senior undergraduate / first-year graduate course introduces the algorithmic foundations of optimization with emphasis on both theory and applications in CS and engineering. Topics include convex sets and functions, necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality, unconstrained and constrained optimization (gradient descent, Newton’s method, projection methods, Lagrange multipliers, KKT conditions), duality theory, and augmented Lagrangian methods. If time permits, we will also cover stochastic, subgradient, and proximal techniques for large-scale or nondifferentiable problems.

== Prerequisites
Multivariable Calculus (directional derivatives, Taylor expansions) and Linear Algebra (vector spaces, inner products, eigenvalues, positive-definite matrices). Instructor approval is required to remain enrolled if prerequisites are not met.

== Materials
We will mostly follow lecture notes (posted on Canvas).\n
