== Biography
*Starting in July 2025, I will be joining the [https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/ Department of Computer Science (CS)] at [https://www.ucsb.edu/ University of California, Santa Barbara].* You can read my [https://engineering.ucsb.edu/news/q-new-coe-faculty-yuheng-bu Q & A interview] with [https://engineering.ucsb.edu/ UCSB College of Engineering].

I am an Assistant Professor in the [https://www.ece.ufl.edu/ Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE)]  at [https://www.ufl.edu/ University of Florida]. 

Before joining the University of Florida, I was a postdoctoral research associate at the [https://www.rle.mit.edu/ Research Laboratory of Electronics] and [https://idss.mit.edu/ Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS)], [https://www.mit.edu/ Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)]. 
I received my Ph.D. degree at the [https://csl.illinois.edu/ Coordinated Science Laboratory] and the [https://ece.illinois.edu/ Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering], [https://illinois.edu/ University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)] in 2019. Before that, I received a B.S. degree (with honors) in [https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/ Electronic Engineering] from [https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm Tsinghua University] in 2014. 

== Research
My research interests lie in the intersection of *machine learning*, *information theory* and *signal processing*. I leverage the tools from /information theory/ and /signal processing/ to develop theoretically justified learning algorithms for diverse applications, including [https://proceedings.mlr.press/v235/liu24e.html /watermarking generative AI/], [https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/shah22a.html /fair machine learning/], [https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/hash/c3177be226ee12e34d6ba3b5e6fe6a5b-Abstract-Conference.html /uncertainty quantification/], [Conference/AAAI_2020.pdf /model compression/].  

More broadly, the primary goal of my research is to lay information-theoretic foundations for trustworthy learning algorithms, particularly with generalization, fairness, and robustness guarantees.
