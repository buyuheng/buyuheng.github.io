== Biography
I am an Assistant Professor with the [https://www.ece.ufl.edu/ Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE)]  at [https://www.ufl.edu/ University of Florida]. 

Before joining the University of Florida, I was a postdoctoral research associate at the [https://www.rle.mit.edu/ Research Laboratory of Electronics] and [https://idss.mit.edu/ Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS)], [https://www.mit.edu/ Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)], working with Prof. [http://allegro.mit.edu/~gww/ Gregory W. Wornell]. 
I received my Ph.D. degree at the [https://csl.illinois.edu/ Coordinated Science Laboratory] and the [https://ece.illinois.edu/ Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering], [https://illinois.edu/ University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)] in 2019, under the supervision of Prof. 
[http://vvv.ece.illinois.edu/  Venugopal V. Veeravalli]. Before that, I received a B.S. degree (with honors) in [https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/ Electronic Engineering] from [https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm Tsinghua University] in 2014. 

== Research
My research interests lie in the intersection of *machine learning*, *information theory* and *signal processing*. I leverage the tools from /information theory/ and /signal processing/ to develop theoretically justified learning algorithms with applications to /fair machine learning/, /uncertainty quantification/, and /anomaly detection/.  

More broadly, the primary goal of my research is to lay information-theoretic foundations for the learning algorithms with limited labeled data, including transfer learning and semi-supervised learning, particularly with privacy, fairness, and/or communication constraints.


== To Prospective Students
Two Ph.D. student positions are available starting in 2023 fall.

Prospective students with:
- interest in one or more of the topics delineated above
- strong backgrounds in *machine learning*, *signal processing*, and some exposure to *information theory* or *statistics* are encouraged to reach out. 

Please send me an email with the subject "Prospective Ph.D. Student" and the following information:
- complete academic CV
- undergraduate/graduate transcripts
- if applicable, one representative publication

While I may not respond to every such email, I will read them.
